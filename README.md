# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing is an excellent way to ensure that code is functional and secure. For example, JUnit tests can stretch and provide wide coverage for almost every scenario. Ensuring that each test is only testing for one metric can also prove to be beneficial and ensuring wide coverage.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
This starts off by ensuring that the system requirements are well understood. For complex requirements breaking them down and keeping everything as clear and simple as possible.

# How do I approach designing software?
Modular design is an approach that I like a lot. It allows for the code to be very organized and easy to find different components. I also make sure to follow best practices and making sure that my code is as readable to an average joe as possible. Iterative development is also a huge approach for me, start off with what the system NEEDS to run and then slowly add more of the desired aspects to it.
